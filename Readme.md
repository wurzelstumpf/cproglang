# The C Programming Language 2nd Edition 1988 

This repository contains completed programming exercises from the
classic book on the C Programming Language by Brian Kernighan and
Dennis Ritchie.

The programs may or may not work satisfactorily and little effort has
gone into testing so be warned!  The Author suggests you tackle the
exercises yourself and compare your program with the one in this
repository (if it exists) to help further your understanding and
learning.  If you find an issue please feel free to fix it and please
initiate a pull request so that I can incorporate the change into the
code base so everyone can benefit.
